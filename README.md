## üëÜ First Iteration

The first iteration was plain old jQuery using the `getJSON` method in an `AJAX` call:

```js
$(document).ready(function () {
  var query = "";
  var url = "";

  $("#search").keyup(function () {
    query = $("#search").val();
    url =
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&search=" +
      query +
      "&format=json&callback=?";
    $.getJSON(url, function (data) {
      $("#articles").html("");
      for (i = 0; i < data[1].length; i++) {
        $("#articles").append(
          "<div id=content><a href=" +
          data[3][i] +
          " ><h2>" +
          data[1][i] +
          "</h2><p>" +
          data[2][i] +
          "</p></a></div>"
        );
      }
    });
  });
});
```

This is fine, and it works, but it is really just *jQuery spaghetti code* and I really wanted to refactor it.

## üí™ Motivation

Besides the fact that this code is *extremely brittle* I wanted to challenge myself by refactoring the app to use modern JavaScript and newer web APIs like `fetch` and promises.

To date, there have been several iterations, some more brittle than even the jQuery version.

For instance, this:

```js

function getArticles() {
  // Can't use let here and even var won't work; its scoped to this block
  // May need query to be global for now
  let query = '';
  let url = '/* API */
  `${query}` +
  '/* end of query string */';
  const input = document.querySelector('input');
  const search = document.getElementById('search');

  // Function is alllll kinds of wrong here
  // Why async await here?
  async function instantSearch(event) {
    // This is wrong
    query = search.value;
    search.textContent += `${event.code}`;
    console.log(json);
    // You're fetching a URL that is assigned to and scoped to
    // another function Fix this!
    return await fetch(url).then(response => response.json());
  }
  input.addEventListener('keyup', instantSearch);
}

// checkout the jQuery on master branch
// Instead of the html jQuery function we could use
// document.getElementById("some id").appendChild('some html')

const clearInput = () => {
  document.getElementById('search').value = null;
}

getArticles();
```

I wrote this code sometime last year and before that was even worse. I don't know what I was trying to accomplish in either of these instances but I have grown up since then.
